# ToothTube
This didn't work as well as I'd hoped. I should probably take another look at the YT API and see if this can be improved, but as it is, this is a failed project.

## Pre-requisites
You'll need an API key from [here](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) (Create credentials, API key, copy the text it gives you), as a text file in the directory of the main script called `api_key.txt`, in order to make queries.
